CINDA is product of International Network of Nuclear Reaction Data Centres (NRDC).

### Content

- CINDA contains bibliographic references to measurements, calculations, reviews, and evaluations 
of neutron cross-sections and other microscopic neutron data compiled by NRDC since 1970.
- In 2005, CINDA format and database are extended by photonuclear and charged particle reaction data.
- Since 2010, CINDA is automatically extended by the new information from EXFOR and 
NSR, see [Doc](https://nds.iaea.org/nrdc/nrdc_2010/working/wp2010-22.pdf).
